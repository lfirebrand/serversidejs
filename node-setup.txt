1. What is npm and what does it do?

npm is a package manager that easily allows you to install packages â€” or sets of files that can be incorporated into an application. Packages are building blocks of open-source code that add functionality and different features to applications. 

2. What kind of information does package.json hold?

package.json files communicate with npm about how an application is structured. The information contained in a package.json file includes a description, author, name, version, keywords, any linked git repots, license (if applicable), as well as dependencies and associate JS scripts. The dependencies value specifies other modules that a given module require to work (i.e. other modules that module is dependent on).
