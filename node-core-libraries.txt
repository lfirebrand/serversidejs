1. Why is the fs core module important for Node development?

fs provides a way to access the server-side file system through code.

2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?

synchronous is synchronous, which means it executes code in sequential order. The program waits for code to finish executing before moving on to the next line of code.

asynchronous (non-sync) means code does not wait for the current code to execute before moving on to the next line (aka it executes asynchronously).

3. Why are modules used?

Modules are simply JS libraries that add functions into your application. basically, they keep things in your code base separated to keep the code cleaner. 

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

Libraries add JS functions into an application. In addition to a few built-in Node functions, there are thousands you can download and add to your application for a variety applications, from image manipulation to routing. The built in fs library is used to access the server-side file system through code.
